            Exercising for 30 minutes a day can have numerous positive effects on your mental well-being. Here are some ways in which regular exercise can benefit you mentally:
            Reduced stress and anxiety: Physical activity stimulates the release of endorphins, which are known as "feel-good" hormones. These endorphins can help reduce feelings of stress and anxiety, promoting a more relaxed state of mind.

            <p>
                Exercise has been shown to increase levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in the brain, which are neurotransmitters associated with feelings of happiness and well-being. Regular exercise can help alleviate symptoms of depression and improve overall mood.
